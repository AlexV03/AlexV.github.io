            <!-- CHANGED: <b> to <h2> -->
            <p>
                Grablings is a game jam game made in 48 hours. The game is about climbing as high as possible with your friend(s) by grabbing each other and placing or throwing your friend onto platforms.
            </p>
            <!-- CHANGED: Removed line breaks, improved phrasing ("getting as high" to "climbing as high"), "to a platform" to "onto platforms" -->

            <h2>Creations I Made</h2>
            <p>
                In this game jam, I primarily created the UI logic for the game and designed the different rooms. I had never created any UI logic in UE5 before, and it was an interesting experience to try out.
            </p>
            <!-- CHANGED: "mainly" to "primarily", removed line breaks -->
            <p>
                The UI works with both keyboard/mouse and controller. With the help of talented artists who created art assets quickly, I was able to rapidly build out the different rooms.
            </p>
            <!-- CHANGED: Reduced repetitive wording about "creating rooms fast/quickly" -->

            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I really enjoyed participating in this game jam and had a lot of fun brainstorming what kind of game we could make and then creating it. I had a talented and great team, and I think we made a fun little local co-op game in the time we had.
            </p>
            <!-- CHANGED: Removed line breaks -->
