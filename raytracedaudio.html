            <p><b>About:</b></p>
            <p>Grablings is a game jam game. We made the game in 48 hours.<br>
                The game is about getting as high as possible together with your friend(s) by grabbing<br>
                each other and placing or throwing your friend to a platform.</p>

            <br>

            <p><b>Creations I made:</b></p>
            <p>In this game jam I mainly created the UI logic for the game and created the different rooms.<br>
                I had never created any UI logic in UE5 before and it was an interesting experience to try out.<br>
                The UI works with keyboard and mouse and with a controller.<br>
                I was able to create the different rooms very fast with the help of very talented artists.<br>
                They created the art assets very quickly, and with that I was able to quickly make the rooms.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p><b>My thoughts:</b></p>
            <p>I really enjoyed participating in this game jam and had a lot of fun brainstorming<br>
                what kind of game we could make and then creating the game.<br>
                I had a talented and great team, and I think we made a fun little local co-op game in the time we had.
            </p>
