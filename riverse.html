            <p><b>About:</b></p>
            <p>
                Riverse is made in my first year at buas with a group of 12 people in the unreal engine game engine,<br>
                we got certain reference games to choose from and we choosed for Cluster truck.<br>
                We had 8 weeks the time to concept the game, work it out and to make it.<br>
                The game is a fast past platform game where you have to reach the goal as fast as possible<br>
                by jumping from platform to platform, abvoiding obstacles and rewinding hinders with your pocketwatch.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p><b>Creation I made:</b></p>
            <p>
                In this project I created the time rewind feature. The feature has the ability to set groups of object
                that can be rewinded, with this
                you can look at a rewindable object then every other object in the same group will be highlighted
                showing that those objects will be
                rewinded back in time when you activate the rewind. I have chosen for this option so you could control
                what to rewind, this fitted with our
                design to give it a better player experience.
            </p>

                    <p>The PlaySnapshot function makes sures that the recorded data is applied to the object correctly.<br>
                    it does this by using a circular buffer using indexes. It grabs a snapshot checks it with the worldtime<br>
                    if it went far enough backwards in time then the current snapshot becomes invalid and it goes to the next<br>
                    snapshot. It loops the index and applies the position and rotation with lerping to the object.<br>
                    The video shows a test with many objects recording and rewinding at the same time to see if the system can<br>
                    handle that.</p>

                    It does this by creating a local snapshot, giving it all the values it needs and then applying it to<br>
                    the snapshots buffer. it then increases the index and if needed loops it.<br>
                    The video to the side shows a test where 2 groups of rewindable objecs are shown. You aim at a object<br>
                    in that group and then when you rewind, all those objects will rewind back in time.<br>
                    without the other group being rewinded.</p>

            <p><b>My thoughts:</b></p>
            <p>
                Making this feature in unreal engine was a fun challenge to do. I hadn't used c++ in ureal engine a lot before so it<br>
                figuring out how to use it was very interesting and i learned a lot from it.
